## Contributing

Feel free to get in touch with any issues or suggestions for new features you'd like to see. I also welcome pull requests to fix bugs or implement new features. The best way to make contact is via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jpanther/Dectorio/issues).

### Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/jpanther/Dectorio/issues).
  > **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/jpanther/Dectorio/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or a **test case** demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring.

### Can you write a patch that fixes a bug or do you want to implement a new feature?

* Fork the `develop` branch.
  > **Note:** The `master` branch is reserved for releases and is always in a 'production-ready' state. The `develop` branch is where the latest changes are developed and tested ahead of the next release.

* Create a new branch in your fork that describes the issue or new feature (i.e. `bugfix-nastybug` or `feature-mynewfeature`)

* Make the changes required to fix the bug or implement the new feature.

* Pull the upstream `develop` branch and merge it into your fork regularly to stay up to date with changes.

* When you're ready to submit your changes, and there are no conflicts with the upstream branch, push your fork and open a new GitHub pull request to the `develop` branch with your patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes what the patch does. If it fixes a reported bug or feature request, include the relevant issue number.
